00:00–00:10 — Opening (10s)
Hello, I’m [Your Name], and this is AgroSense Agent — an AI assistant built to help smallholder farmers in Northern Nigeria get fair prices and practical advice.

00:10–00:30 — Problem (20s)
Farmers often sell at low prices because they lack timely market information and direct buyer access. This leads to lost income and increased vulnerability.

00:30–01:10 — Solution & quick tour (40s)
AgroSense provides market prices, short-term forecasts, weather alerts, and buyer suggestions in English and Hausa. It runs locally with mock data for reliable demos and can be enabled with Azure OpenAI for richer, multilingual conversations.
Here’s the app: I’ll ask for the maize price in Kano, get a forecast, then show the Hausa voice demo.

01:10–02:10 — Live demo (60s)
(On-screen) Type: “What is maize price in Kano?”
Narration: The app returns the current price and a 7‑day forecast with a recommendation. Next, I’ll switch to Hausa voice input.
(Use mic) Speak: “Yaya farashin masara a Kano?”
Result: The assistant replies in Hausa with the same actionable advice and a suggested buyer contact.

02:10–02:40 — Impact & validation (30s)
With local deployment and buyer linkages, farmers can increase revenue and reduce reliance on middlemen. Our forecasting logic is in `backend/controllers/forecastController.js` and unit-tested (Jest).

02:40–03:00 — Closing (20s)
